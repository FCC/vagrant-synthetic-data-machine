vagrant-synthetic-data-machine
==============================

A CentOS 6.3 Vagrant box for generating synthetic data

# What?

This will be a vagrant virtual machine you can download and create synthetic data using a web interface.

# Why?

Because it should be easy for economist, policymaker, or developer in Government to have fake data to test and use before collecting real data. Having synthetic data that does not represent real people or organizations makes it easier to develop data collections transparently.

# How?

This virtual machine (VM) will include one or more open source libraries/tools for generating synthetic data.

To use it, you will just need to install Virtualbox (ideally).


# When?

Hopefully this will all be working by the end of April.
