	// REQUIRED METHODS

	/**
	 * This is the main workhorse function: it does the work of actually generating a random data snippet.
	 *
	 * @param object $generator the main Generator object, through which a Data Type can call the various
	 *     available public methods.
	 * @param array $generationContextData a hash of information relating to the generation context. Namely:
	 *     "rowNum"             => the row number in the generated content (indexed from 1)
	 *     "generationOptions"  => whatever options were passed for this particular row and data type; i.e.
	 *                             whatever information was returned by getRowGenerationOptions(). This data
	 *                             can be empty or contain anything needed - in whatever format. By default,
	 *                             this is set to null.
	 *     "existingRowData"    => depending on the Data Type's processOrder, this will contain all the data
	 *                             from fields that have already been processed.
	 * @return array Data Types have to return a hash with at least one key: "display". They can also load up
	 *     the hash with whatever else they want, if they want to provide additional meta data to other Data
	 *     Types that are being generated on that row (e.g. Country, passing it's country_slug info to Region)

	 *
	 * @param string $content "ui" / "generation". Data Types are instantiated in one of two contexts: once when
	 *    the main UI page loads, so that the Data Type can be presented as an option for selection in the Data
	 *    Generator, and secondly when we're actually actually generating the results. It's sometimes beneficial
